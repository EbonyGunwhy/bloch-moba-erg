This folder is only used to reproduce the gold-standard fitting values for the NIST phantom:

`05b_IR-bSSFP_NIST/ref_values_nist.txt`.

This analysis requires python3.
To have the run scripts for this scripts independent from python, the reference *.txt file has been already added to the directory `05b_IR-bSSFP_NIST`.
